The Acer Aspire 7 features an air-inlet keyboard, a clever innovation that expels up to 10% more heat than a non-air inlet keyboard. It's all about keeping your laptop cool under pressure.

It's a design that's as functional as it is beautiful. |  When it's time to work or play in low-light conditions, the backlit keyboard comes to your rescue, ensuring you can do more from wherever, whenever. |  Your gaming and creative endeavours deserve a canvas that does justice to your imagination. The Acer Aspire 7 delivers with its FHD IPS display, boasting an impressive 81.67% screen-to-body ratio. Acer BlueLightShield technology ensures viewing comfort, reducing eye strain during marathon gaming sessions or long editing stints. With Acer ExaColor technology, you have precise control over colours, ensuring that your visuals are as vibrant and accurate as your vision. |  In the world of high-speed file sharing, the Acer Aspire 7 is your ultimate companion. With seamless connectivity options, you can effortlessly transfer files at lightning speed. And when it's time to immerse yourself in entertainment, the Thunderbolt 4 port opens the door to a world of possibilities. Connect an 8K display for an immersive experience that's beyond compare. It's all about staying connected and entertained with minimal effort. |  Communication is more critical than ever, whether you're attending online courses or staying in touch with loved ones. Acer understands this, and that's why they've equipped the Aspire 7 with Acer PurifiedVoice featuring AI noise reduction. This intelligent technology actively suppresses background noise, ensuring crystal-clear audio for both you and the person on the other end of the line. |  And it doesn't stop there – it's compatible with external headphones and microphones, giving you the flexibility you need for any situation. With the Acer Aspire 7, your voice is heard, loud and clear.",https://www.amazon.in/dp/B0D45THCGJ,54990,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41LMzzdYO+L.jpg,9,"""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41LMzzdYO+L.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41JPW93JGnL.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/413JArAWUFL.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41gl7NpGolL.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31jNPO5GOIL.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41HF+de1qcL.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41E-l+Rt8OL.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41u-2bnDpJL.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41PKJCjGAFL.jpg""","Acer Aspire 7 Gaming Laptop 12th Gen Intel Core i5 (Windows 11 Home/ 16 (1*16) GB/ 512 GB SSD/ NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2050/144 Hz Refresh Rate) A715-76G with 39.6 cm (15.6"") FHD Display, Charcoal Black, 2.1 KG",https://store.acer.com/en-in/acer-aspire-7-gaming-laptop-12th-gen-intel-core-i5-windows-11-home-16-1-16-gb-512-gb-ssd-nvidia-geforce-rtx-2050-144-hz-refresh-rate-a715-76g-with-39-6-cm-15-6-fhd-display-charcoal-black-2-1-kg-nh-qmysi-003,LED,50 Wh,Lithium Ion (Li-Ion),Yes,Supports Bluetooth 5.2,Charcoal Black,23.74 cm,IPS (In-Plane Switching) Technology,"15.6"" display with IPS (In-Plane Switching) technology, Full HD 1920 x 1080, Acer ComfyView LED-backlit TFT LCD, 16:9 aspect ratio, supporting 144 Hz refresh rate",,Yes,"E-mail: ail.easycare@acer.com Contact number：1800-11-6677 (For Laptop & Tablet), 1800-11-4100 ( For Desktop, Monitor & All in One ) Support Timings – 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM ( Monday to Saturday, except public holidays )",E-mail: acerindia.enquiries@acer.com Contact number: 1860-120-2019,NVIDIA®️,NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2050 (144 Hz Refresh Rate),,Yes,,1.99 cm,,Yes,"99-/100-/103-key Acer backlit keyboard with international language support, with indicators of CapsLock and F4/Microphone mute","QuantaTech-Front(Chongqing)Computer Co., Ltd(Quanta Chongqing), 18#,Zongbao Road, Shapingba District, Chongqing, China","ACER INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED Embassy Heights, 6th Floor, No. 13, Magrath Road, Next to HOSMAT Hospital, Bangalore, INDIA – 560025",32 GB,DDR4 SDRAM,Yes,,3.0,1.0,2,,Windows 11 Home,64-bit,,"1U (contains Laptop 1N, Power cord 1N, Adapter 1N, User Manual 1N)","Multi-gesture secure touchpad, supporting two-finger scroll; pinch; gestures to open Cortana, Action Center, multitasking; Fingerprint application commands",3-pin 135 W AC Adapter,,Intel Core i5-12450H,,,Core™ i5,1920 x 1080,"39.6 cm (15.6"")",,"512 GB, PCIe Gen4, 16 Gb/s, NVMe",Stereo,Yes,16 GB,"2 x USB 3.2 port, 1 x USB USB 3.2 port with power-off charging, 1 x USB Type-C port/Thunderbolt 4 port",512 GB,Yes,One-year International Travelers Warranty (ITW),Yes,T-Type HD camera with 1280 x 720 resolution and 720p HD video at 30 fps with Temporal Noise Reduction,2.1 KG,36.23 cm,Yes,,Intel Wireless Wi-Fi 6E AX211,,,,,Dedicated,,GDDR6,,,,,,,,,,,Acer Aspire 7 Gaming

And when it's time to work or play in low-light conditions. |  Your gaming and creative endeavours deserve a canvas that does justice to your imagination. The Acer Aspire 7 delivers with its FHD IPS display, boasting an impressive 81.67% screen-to-body ratio. Acer BlueLightShield technology ensures viewing comfort, reducing eye strain during marathon gaming sessions or long editing stints.

With seamless connectivity options, you can effortlessly transfer files at lightning speed. And when it's time to immerse yourself in entertainment, the Thunderbolt 4 port opens the door to a world of possibilities. Connect an 8K display for an immersive experience that's beyond compare. It's all about staying connected and entertained with minimal effort. |  Communication is more critical than ever, whether you're attending online courses or staying in touch with loved ones. Acer understands this, and that's why they've equipped the Aspire 7 with Acer PurifiedVoice featuring AI noise reduction. This intelligent technology actively suppresses background noise, ensuring crystal-clear audio for both you and the person on the other end of the line. |  And it doesn't stop there – it's compatible with external headphones and microphones, giving you the flexibility you need for any situation. With the Acer Aspire 7, your voice is heard, loud and clear.",https://www.amazon.in/dp/B0D45T32HD,53990,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41LMzzdYO+L.jpg,9,"""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41LMzzdYO+L.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/413JArAWUFL.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41JPW93JGnL.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41gl7NpGolL.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31jNPO5GOIL.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41E-l+Rt8OL.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41HF+de1qcL.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41u-2bnDpJL.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41PKJCjGAFL.jpg""","Acer Aspire 7 Gaming Laptop 12th Gen Intel Core i5 (Windows 11 Home/ 8 (1*8) GB/ 512 GB SSD/ NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2050/144 Hz) A715-76G with 39.6 cm (15.6"") FHD Display and 45% NTSC Color Gamut, Charcoal Black, 2.1 KG",https://store.acer.com/en-in/acer-aspire-7-gaming-laptop-12th-gen-intel-core-i5-windows-11-home-8-gb-512-gb-ssd-nvidia-geforce-rtx-2050-144-hz-a715-76g-with-39-6-cm-15-6-fhd-display-and-45-ntsc-color-gamut-charcoal-black-2-1-kg-nh-qmysi-001,,50 Wh,Lithium Ion (Li-Ion),Yes,Supports Bluetooth 5.1,Charcoal Black,23.74 cm,IPS (In-Plane Switching) Technology,"39.6 cm (15.6"") IPS Display with Full HD 1920 x 1080, Acer ComfyView LED-backlit TFT LCD",,Yes,"E-mail: ail.easycare@acer.com Contact number：1800-11-6677 (For Laptop & Tablet), 1800-11-4100 ( For Desktop, Monitor & All in One ) Support Timings – 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM ( Monday to Saturday, except public holidays )",E-mail: acerindia.enquiries@acer.com Contact number: 1860-120-2019,NVIDIA®️,NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2050,,Yes,,1.99 cm,,Yes,"99-/100-/103-key Acer backlit keyboard with international language support, with indicators of CapsLock and F4/Microphone mute","QuantaTech-Front(Chongqing)Computer Co., Ltd(Quanta Chongqing), 18#,Zongbao Road, Shapingba District, Chongqing, China","ACER INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED Embassy Heights, 6th Floor, No. 13, Magrath Road, Next to HOSMAT Hospital, Bangalore, INDIA – 560025",32 GB,DDR4 SDRAM,,Yes,3.0,1.0,,,Windows 11 Home,64-bit,,"1U (contains Laptop 1N, Power cord 1N, Adapter 1N, User Manual 1N)","Multi-gesture secure touchpad, supporting two-finger scroll; pinch; gestures to open Cortana, Action Center, multitasking; Fingerprint application commands",3-pin 135 W AC Adapter,,Intel Core i5-12450H,,,Core™ i5,1920 x 1080,"39.6 cm (15.6"")",,"512 GB, PCIe Gen4, 16 Gb/s, NVMe",Stereo,Yes,8 GB,"2x USB 3.2 port, 1x USB USB 3.2 port with power-off  charging, 1x USB Type-C port  /Thunderbolt™ 4 port",512 GB,Yes,One-year International Travelers Warranty (ITW),Yes,T-Type HD camera with 1280 x 720 resolution and 720p HD video at 30 fps with Temporal Noise Reduction,2.1 KG,36.23 cm,Yes,,Wi-Fi 6E,,,,,Dedicated,,GDDR6,,,,,,,,,,,Acer Aspire 7 Gaming
